# dotfiles
Config files and such that I use across my dev environments.

Sourced on/Inspired by https://dotfiles.github.io/

I was compelled to create this repo since I wanted to alias npm to pnpm so I couldn't accidentally mix the two when copying install commands or just using the terminal without making an opinionated change to my docker containers or project files. I plan on adding more with time, including a vimrc config once I feel the need to use pure vim/neovim... VSCode is one hell of a drug. Not even sure why I'm writing all this in the readme, really just a note to myself so I don't forget why I should commit more configs here.
